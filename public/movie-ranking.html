<H1>The BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO ANGEL</H1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Mean Girls</h3>
<p> Mean girls is a classic comedy created by Tina Fey. Best Lindsay Lohan movie! So many one-liners that are still iconic 10 years later 
</p>

<h3> The Saw Franchise</h3>
<p> Any saw movie is a good movie. You have suspense,gore, and a good story. Keeps you on your feet.</p>

<h3> Freaky Friday </h3>
<p> Another 2000's classic staring Lindsay Lohan. Good Music.</p>
